# CFB-RecruitPitchCalc
<b>This app is standalone from EA!</b>

It's a side project I took on to remove the guess work from the dynasty recruiting process. Rather than having to manually figure out which pitch to hard sell... I figured I could make a computer figure it out for me.

It's very much a work in progress, so let me know if/what bugs you experience!
